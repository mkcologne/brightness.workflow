Alfred Workflow to set Display Brightness

Since macos 12.3 broke my Workflow from @fniephaus (https://github.com/fniephaus/alfred-brightness)
I made a new one based on 'brightness' from @nriley (https://github.com/nriley/brightness).
Thanks to both of them!

You can install it with brew:
brew install brightness

You can set brightness in steps by 10 or a number between 1 and 100.

Enjoy!
